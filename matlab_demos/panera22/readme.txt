/a/ks/b/matlab/panera22/readme.txt

The files in this dir are used to help me work with 30 minute bars from SPY.

The main script I work with is pspy.m; it gets recent prices and then issues predictions.

Also I built another script of interest: bt2_call.m

I use it to backtest the LR2LR mechanisms which drive pspy.m

Results from bt2_call.m are described in these 2 files:
