This directory contains a skeleton example
of how to link to the C-API

The basic requirements to use the exported xts
C code is:

(1) Add to your DESCRIPTION file:

  Depends: xts
  linkingTo: xts

(2) In your .c files:

  #include "xtsAPI.h"

This header file exports the functions that are
public in xts.

(3) Compile as you would with any other package:

  R CMD build api_example
  R CMD INSTALL linkXTS_1.0.tar.gz

(4) Try it out!

  R> require(linkXTS)
  R> checkOrder(1:10)
  [1] TRUE
  R> checkOrder(c(1:10,1))
  [1] FALSE
