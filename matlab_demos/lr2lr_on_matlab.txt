lr2lr gives much better results on Matlab than it does on spy611.

Plain lr gives dismal results on both (for 2014).

Matlab results are here:

To reproduce this on your laptop,
Install Matlab R2014a (8.3.0.532) 64-bit (glnxa64) February 11, 2014
Then run panera20.m

These scripts will not run on old versions of Matlab.
