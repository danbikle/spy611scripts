The files in this dir are used to backtest close-to-open predictions of SPY.

I run the backtests with btspy.m

Also I provide a script to generate predictions near noon:55 California time which is 5 minutes before market close.

That script is:

noon55co.m

I run it after I add an estimate for closing price to noon55price.m
